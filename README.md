# ImageEditor

A terminal-based modular image processing pipeline via JSON configs and custom filters.

- Fully extendable â€” define your own filters by inheriting from BaseFilter
- Runs filters sequentially using config files
- CLI interface: `edit-image`

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or use the following script:

May need xdg-utils for displaying images on linux (+ wslview if on wsl)
